##  Sprint4Jwt
This is a repo for a Register/Log in Page backend using Spring Boot, Spring Security and JWT (JSON Web Token) to authenticate different endpoints used. 
There are 2 roles: 
- USER, who can register or log in using his credentials and gets authenticated using his JWT, then need login again after the JWT expires.
- ADMIN, who can view all users logged in and their information.
